This repository aims to create simple HTML websites to work on iPad 2 A1395.

For now, we only have Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange rates.

I would appreciate everyone's contribution to create websites that can keep older iPads running with pages that can stay on the screen all the time with useful information.
  
We have a .TXT file that stores the latest BTC and ETH quotes, updated every 5 minutes.

In addition, we have an index.html file that displays the quotes on the screens of older iPads.
